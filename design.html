                    <p>This was a design project for the mobile prototype of the BioNote alpha. The app allows users to log
                        photos of species they saw and collaboratively identify the species with the help of the community.
                        I designed the initial mobile and web apps before we brought in dedicated designers to the startup.</p>

                    <p>This was a single-day hackathon project to make a chatbot that used BioNote services to log and identify
                        a species through a conversational 'chatbot' experience.</p>
                    <p>Users could chat with "Biobo" over Facebook Messenger and ask basic questions about a species. Users
                        could also send Biobo an image over chat and Biobo would automatically log the image as a post on
                        the BioNote platform.</p>
                    <p>The bot would automatically pull location, date and other useful information for logging the species
                        occurence from the image file. All while giving a super cheerful and helpful UX in a minimalistic
                        conversational UI.</p>

                    <p>There are many great digital design tools out there, but there is one that stands out as the strongest
                        for User Interface design, and that's
                        <a href="http://sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a>. It is easily learned, and the strong community of designers and developers have tooling
                        for whatever you might want. It also plays nicely with others.</p>
                    <p>The point of creating the meetup was to bring together professional and hobbyist designers in the area
                        to do talks with hands-on design activities. So many meetups have inspiring speakers and great people
                        giving great advice, but we in the tech community in Göteborg were really craving more hands-on,
                        jump right in kind of meetups.</p>
