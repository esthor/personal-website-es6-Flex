                <p>It took me a long time to realize I took the value of good design for granted. I've been trying to catch up ever since.</p>

                <h2>Project: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Sketch-App-Meetup-Goteborg/" target="_blank">Sketch & Design Göteborg Meetup</a></h2>
                    <p>There are many great digital design tools out there, but there is one that stands out as the strongest for User Interface design, and that's <a href="http://sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a>. It is easily learned, and the strong community of designers and developers have tooling for whatever you might want. It also plays nicely with others.</p>
                    <p>The point of creating the meetup was to bring together professional and hobbyist designers in the area to do talks with hands-on design activities. So many meetups have inspiring speakers and great people giving great advice, but we in the tech community in Göteborg were really craving more hands-on, jump right in kind of meetups.</p>
                    <p>If you are on the west coast of Sweden, be sure to check out a meetup!</p>
