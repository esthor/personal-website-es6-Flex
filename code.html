                <p>I professionally code in modern JavaScript frameworks, like React and React Native and Node.js. In my
                    free time coding I try out different frameworks, libraries and languages, explore and customize my environments
                    and tooling, and use my coding and data science skills in areas that I'm especially passionate about,
                    like politics, the environment and music creation.</p>
                <p>Below, I will briefly highlight some projects, with links to more info where appropriate.</p>

                <h2>Project: Mac Podcast App</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/esthor/overcast-electron-app-mac" class="text-link" rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">github.com/esthor/overcast-electron-app-mac</a>
                </p>

                    <img src="./img/overcast-electron-app.gif" alt="animation showing the basic use of the podcast player">
                </center>
                <p>
                    I was annoyed with not having a desktop podcast app that would sync with my phone and tablet podcast app. Overcast was the
                    natural choice because I was already using their iOS apps, and they provide a web interface, syncing
                    podcast subscriptions and play positions. They just didn't have a macOS app. So, I used <a
                        href="https://github.com/jiahaog/Nativefier">nativefier</a> to wrap the overcast.fm web app into a desktop
                    app, with Electron doing the work under the hood.
                </p>
                <p> I also published the app as an executable on <a href="https://github.com/esthor/overcast-electron-app-mac/releases"
                        rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, as well as the whole <a href="https://github.com/esthor/overcast-electron-app-mac/releases"
                        rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">git repo</a> for the project. I wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/unhype/i-made-a-podcast-app-for-mac-in-less-than-an-hour-695736895a9f"
                        rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about it as well. I have gotten some positive feedback
                    from users. I am not the only one to have had this lack-of-desktop-podcast-app problem.
                </p>

                <h2>Project: Mac Google Hangouts App</h2>
                <center>
                    <img src="./img/google-hangouts-electron-app.gif" alt="animation showing the basic use of the Google Hangouts macOS app">
                </center>
                <p>
                    I prefer to not have long messages on my phone, since a keyboard and staying on my computer screen is much faster and more
                    convenient. I have one friend that likes to use Google Hangouts to chat, but there is no native or free
                    Google Hangouts app for macOS. So, following on the usefulness of nativefier, as with the podcast app,
                    I spun up a Google Hangouts app for macOS desktop utilizing Electron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have not published it, yet. But I plan to. Hopefully other people will find it useful, too.
                </p>

                <h2>Project:
                    <a href="./eval/some-software-co-coding-evaluation.html">Some Software Co. Coding Evaluation</a>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="./eval/some-software-co-coding-evaluation.html" class="text-link" rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">unhype.me/eval/some-software-co-coding-evaluation.html</a>

                        <img src="./img/some-software-eval.gif" alt="An animation showing the responsiveness of the coding evaluation site"></a>
                </center>
                <p>This was the product of a take-home design+coding challenge. The coding requirements were:
                    <ul class="">
                        <li class="coding-eval-li-strong">*All CSS and JS needs to be inline, in one HTML file*</li>
                        <li class="coding-eval-li">Using Javascript, print out to the page the viewport dimensions. This
                            should be done on page load and on page resize.</li>
                        <li class="coding-eval-li">Using Javascript, print out to the page the coordinates of the last click
                            or touch</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To implement the JS parts, I used event listeners on the window. I set one listening for <code>resize</code>                        (which
                        would also capture initial viewport dimensions) and then trigger a function print them out. I set
                        two other event listeners for <code>click</code> and <code>touchstart</code> which would trigger
                        their respective event handler functions which would cache the X and Y coordinates and print them
                        out either as "Last Click Coordinates" or "Last Touch Coordinates". To read about the design requirement,
                        check out the project description on my <a href="./design.html" class="text-link" rel="norefferer"

                    <h2>Project:
                        <a href="./index.html">Portfolio (This Site!)</a>
                    </h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The idea behind this portfolio site is to showcase a little bit about who I am and where my intellectual
                        and creative energy is spent. I have chosen to build this site from scratch using only vanilla web
                        languages, without the assistance of any third-party libraries, frameworks or templates.</p>
                    <p>I have implemented the layout here using my homemade flexbox layout. You can find
                        <a href="https://github.com/esthor/personal-website-es6-Grid">my CSS Grid implentation here</a>.
                        It feels like it has been so long since I have actually worked with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and I felt
                        I barely touch these foundations of the web given how easy and common frameworks are. But for a simple
                        portfolio site, I don't need bells and whistles that pay dividends at scale. That said, I may refactor
                        this site in different technologies in the React ecosystem, for fun and to explore some less-than-production-ready
                        features and plugins. Angular 2 and VueJS are on my bucket list, too!</p>

                    <p>This is a fun little project to split expenses between 2 parties based on relative income.</p>
                    <p>I don't know how useful it is, but it's a way to think about income inequality and put your money
                        where your mouth is. Right now it's just implemented as an in-browser script, but I intend to use
                        it as a 'Hello World' template for trying out different frameworks with a little more logic than
                        a
                        <code>print</code> command.</p>
