                <p>I professionally code in modern JavaScript frameworks, like React and React Native and Node.js. In my free
                    time coding I try out different frameworks, libraries and languages, explore and customize my environments
                    and tooling, and use my coding and data science skills in areas that I'm especially passionate about,
                    like politics, the environment and music creation.</p>
                <p>Below, I will briefly highlight some projects, with links to more info where appropriate.</p>


                <h2>Project:
                    <a href="./eval/some-software-co-coding-evaluation.html">Some Software Co. Coding Evaluation</a>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="./eval/some-software-co-coding-evaluation.html" class="text-link" rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">unhype.me/eval/some-software-co-coding-evaluation.html</a>
                </p>
                <p>This was the product of a take-home design+coding challenge. The coding requirements were:
                    <ul class="">
                        <li class="coding-eval-li-strong">*All CSS and JS needs to be inline, in one HTML file*</li>
                        <li class="coding-eval-li">Using Javascript, print out to the page the viewport dimensions. This should be done on page load and on page resize.</li>
                        <li class="coding-eval-li">Using Javascript, print out to the page the coordinates of the last click or touch</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>To implement the JS parts, I used event listeners on the window. I set one listening for <code>resize</code> (which would also capture initial viewport dimensions) and then trigger a function print them out. I set two other event listeners for <code>click</code> and <code>touchstart</code> which would trigger their respective event handler functions which would cache the X and Y coordinates and print them out either as "Last Click Coordinates" or "Last Touch Coordinates".
                    </p>



                <h2>Project:
                    <a href="./index.html">Portfolio (This Site!)</a>
                </h2>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>The idea behind this portfolio site is to showcase a little bit about who I am and where my intellectual
                    and creative energy is spent. I have chosen to build this site from scratch using only vanilla web languages,
                    without the assistance of any third-party libraries, frameworks or templates.</p>
                <p>I have implemented the layout here using my homemade flexbox layout. You can find
                    <a href="https://github.com/esthor/personal-website-es6-Grid">my CSS Grid implentation here</a>. It feels like it has been so long since I have actually worked with
                    vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and I felt I barely touch these foundations of the web given how easy and common
                    frameworks are. But for a simple portfolio site, I don't need bells and whistles that pay dividends at
                    scale. That said, I may refactor this site in different technologies in the React ecosystem, for fun
                    and to explore some less-than-production-ready features and plugins. Angular 2 and VueJS are on my bucket
                    list, too!</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/esthor/marxian-split" rel="norefferer" rel="noopener">Marxian Split</a>

                </p>
                <p>This is a fun little project to split expenses between 2 parties based on relative income.</p>
                <p>I don't know how useful it is, but it's a way to think about income inequality and put your money where your
                    mouth is. Right now it's just implemented as an in-browser script, but I intend to use it as a 'Hello
                    World' template for trying out different frameworks with a little more logic than a
                    <code>print</code> command.</p>
