                <p>I spend most of my time coding professionally in modern JavaScript frameworks like React and React Native. In my free time coding I try out different languages, explore and customize my environments and tooling, and use my coding and data science skills in areas that I'm especially passionate about, like politics, the environment and music creation.</p>
                <p>Below, I will briefly highlight some projects, with links to more info where appropriate.</p>                
                <h2>Project: <a href="./index.html">Portfolio (This Site!)</a></h2>
                <p>The idea behind this portfolio site is to showcase a little bit about who I am and where my intellectual and creative energy is spent. I have chosen to build this site from scratch using only vanilla web languages, without the assistance of any third-party libraries, frameworks or templates.</p>
                <p>I have implemented the layout here using my homemade flexbox layout. You can find <a href="https://github.com/esthor/personal-website-es6-Grid">my CSS Grid implentation here</a>. It feels like it has been so long since I have actually worked with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and I felt I barely touch these foundations of the web given how easy and common frameworks are. But for a simple portfolio site, I don't need bells and whistles that pay dividends at scale. That said, I may refactor this site in different technologies in the React ecosystem, for fun and to explore some less-than-production-ready features and plugins. Angular 2 and VueJS are on my bucket list, too!</p>                
                <h2>Project: <a href="https://github.com/esthor/marxian-split" target="_blank">Marxian Split</a></h2>
                <p>This is a fun little project to split expenses between 2 parties based on relative income.</p>
                <p>I don't know how useful it is, but it's a way to think about income inequality and put your money where your mouth is. Right now it's just implemented as an in-browser script, but I intend to use it as a 'Hello World' template for trying out different frameworks with a little more logic than a <code>print</code> command.</p>
